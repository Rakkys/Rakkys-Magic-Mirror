- added an creative tab that holds the magic mirrors
- moved gaze tooltip to be an easter egg hidden behind F3 + H, just so people don't get confused on how to use the mirror
- removed teleportation checks if you're in creative
- particles and sound effects should now play when `rakkys-instantMagicMirror` is false, hopefully

BUGS STILL REQUIRE FIXING
- Make the flash particle appear if you have `rakkys-instantMagicMirror` turned to true
